===========

![Alt text](/app_figs/point-graph-icon.png)

PlotExtract is a tool for digitizing plots.


## Requirements

PlotExtract uses code from the General C++ Classes project.  Code for this project
may be found on GitHub at https://github.com/rgrandin/CppClasses.  The C++ classes
should be cloned to a directory alongside the directory containing PlotExtract.  If
the classes are cloned to a different directory, the INCLUDEPATH variable within
PlotExtract.pro must be updated to contain the new location.
